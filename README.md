We propose the first deep menu-based method for single-bidder combinatorial auctions that is dominant-strategy incentive compatible and revenue-optimizing, by adapting continuous flow matching for optimization problems.


Run the code with the following command:

`python main.py --valuation=combinatorial --n_items=50 --value_file=data/arbitrary_uniform_tensor_50.pt`
